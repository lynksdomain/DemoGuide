# Demo Guide

You will create a 3-4 minute demo for your API project. The structure should be: Introduction, Problem, Solution, Demo, and lastly Q&A


# Introduction
This should simply be your name and role in your project. Given that all of you worked on your own projects, you can say you are the creator or sole developer of your app. When you work in groups, you will have different roles to say but for now, we will use those two.

# Problem

This is the part where you state what compelled you to create this app. The more you humanize it and build a story around it, the easier it will be to connect to it. You want to really hone in on the one thing your app solves (or helps in solving). Example:

"As a photographer, I always wanted a way to easily share my pictures with my friends and strangers. There was no easy way of viewing, liking and commenting on my pictures nor a way for me to easily upload my pictures as the moments arise." (Instagram)

# Solution

Here you state how your app solves the problem above. You want to avoid any technical terms in these explanations as much as possible. Summarize the main features your app provides and give a streamlined over view of what to expect in the upcoming demo.

Example:

"...This is why I created Instagram. Users can follow me and will be up to date with all the pictures I upload. I'll be notified to likes and comments so feedback is immediate and using the built in camera feature, taking pictures is easier than ever." 

# Demo

You will project your app for the audience and go through the main features. Depending on your app, you may have a main functionality (taking a picture, uploading the picture using instagram as the model) and have secondary feature (dm's, the explore tab, the settings menu). You want to really make sure you demo the main features over the secondary so plan the route you will take in your app accordingly. Using instagram, you would take a picture, upload the picture, then show the picture in the feed, show it being liked and commented on. 

# Q&A

They ask, you answer.
